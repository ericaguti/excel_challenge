## Overview of Project
Funding and timing are crucial factors when launching a new project, this is especially important when opening a play. Louise has gather funding to lauch her play _Fever_, which has fell short of achieving its set funding goal. Using data compiled from several Kickstarter campaigns to help Louise determine the best possible time to launch her play, and the success rate of plays that have met their funding goal. The purpose of this analysis to examine the correlation between launch dates and funding goals amongst different campaigns of plays launched overall success and failed rate. 
## Analysis 
The objective of this analysis to visualize the outcomes of campaigns based on launch date, followed by analysis based on goals. First using the dataset to examine the results of the launch date, to see the ideal time to launch a play. Using the initial data sheet to create a _Years_ column, to extract the year from the date of launch information with the help of the `YEAR()` function. Now with this information, we were able to create a table that shows the successful, failed, and canceled outcomes of theater projects based on when they were launched. It appears the optimal time to launch would be from April to June. There is an upward trend starting in April peaking around May with a minimal decline until July, followed by a steady decline thereafter.

The outcomes of campaigns based on funding goals with less than $1000 goal set results show a 76% success rate with a 24% fail rate. While campaigns with less than $5000 funding goals have a 73% of success rate with a 27% fail rate . Any funding goal set higher than $5000 set, show a decline in success rate, and a higher fail rate. This data was achieved by using `COUNTIFS()` function on the dataset to see the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays from their funding goal achieved.

## Challenges 
A challenge I encountered was during the _Outcomes Based on Goals_ sections. I had successfully used the `COUNTIFS()` function on two columns, yet when I was using the function on the_ Number Canceled_ column I encountered an error message, “you’re entered too many arguments for this function”. At first, I thought, the error might have been in the criteria’s I entered. I redid the criteria and ranges several times until, I cleared everything out. I realized that I had entered the wrong function. I had entered `COUNTIF()`, once I realized my error, I was able to complete the columns data set. 
## Result
# What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
Based on the _Theater Outcomes by Launch Date_ data the best time to launch a project in the theater would be in May or June. In the month of May the number of successful plays launched were 111, and in the month of June there were 100 successful plays launched. Combined these months had 211 successful projects, with a combined fail rate of 101 projects. Although April and July also showed a strong success rate as well, in May and June the success seem to peak.From this data more projects were launched in total during the spring and summer months than the fall and winter months. For example, the total project launched in May were 166, as opposed to December where only 75 projects were launched. From this data we can concluded, plays have a higher rate of success if they are launched between April and July, with the most optimal time being May and June. 
# What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?!
What can be concluded from the _Outcomes based on Goals_ data set, is that plays that need less funding had a higher success rate. Project that needed less than $5000 in funding have a 73% success rate than projects that need more that $5000. Additionally, projects that needs less that $1000 had a 76% success rate than those project that need more. Projects that need more than $5000 have a steady rise in fail rate, in the dataset there are two outliers projects that were successful with a higher funding goal, that affected the trend of the graph. Based on these outcomes we can conclude, projects that need minial funding seem to be more successful than projects that need to be heavily funded. 
Overall, it can be concluded that Louise’s play has a higher chance of being a success, since they are already close to their funding goal and it would be best for them to launch the play between May and June. 
# What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation of this dataset is the definition of a “successful” campaign. Some campaigns barely passed their “goal” amount while others surpassed their “goal” amount by thousands. Additionally, how the longevity of each project affected their success and fail rate outcomes.  Another limitation is if these projects were launched in big cities or small towns, which is a factor in their success rate.
# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another possible table that could be created to see if certain years produced more successful, or failed project against other years. A graph that could be created is the success of the project vs the blurb for the project. Which can be taken a step further, to see how a wordy blurb faired vs a vague blurb.
